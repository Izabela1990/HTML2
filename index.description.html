    <p>Early years
    
    Lui Mihai Eminescu, 1932 Oscar Han sculpture, Constanța
    Mihail (as he appears in baptismal records) or Mihai (the more common form of the name that he used) was born in
    Botoșani, Moldavia. He spent his early childhood in Botoșani and Ipotești, in his parents family home. From 1858 to 1866
    he attended school in Cernăuți. He finished 4th grade as the 5th of 82 students, after which he attended two years of
    gymnasium. The first evidence of Eminescu as a writer is in 1866. In January of that year Romanian teacher Aron Pumnul
    died and his students in Cernăuţi published a pamphlet, Lăcrămioarele învățăceilor gimnaziaști (The Tears of the
    Gymnasium Students) in which a poem entitled La mormântul lui Aron Pumnul (At the Grave of Aron Pumnul) appears, signed
    "M. Eminovici". On 25 February his poem De-aș avea (If I Had) was published in Iosif Vulcan's literary magazine Familia
    in Pest. This began a steady series of published poems (and the occasional translation from German). Also, it was Iosif
    Vulcan, who disliked the Slavic source suffix "-ici" of the young poet's last name, that chose for him the more apparent
    Romanian "nom de plume" Mihai Eminescu.
    
    In 1867, he joined Iorgu Caragiale's troupe as a clerk and prompter; the next year he transferred to Mihai Pascaly's
    troupe. Both of these were among the leading Romanian theatrical troupes of their day, the latter including Matei Millo
    and Fanny Tardini-Vlădicescu [ro]. He soon settled in Bucharest, where at the end of November he became a clerk and
    copyist for the National Theater. Throughout this period, he continued to write and publish poems. He also paid his rent
    by translating hundreds of pages of a book by Heinrich Theodor Rotscher, although this never resulted in a completed
    work. Also at this time he began his novel Geniu pustiu (Wasted Genius), published posthumously in 1904 in an unfinished
    form.
    
    On April 1, 1869, he was one of the co-founders of the "Orient" literary circle, whose interests included the gathering
    of Romanian folklore and documents relating to Romanian literary history. On 29 June, various members of the "Orient"
    group were commissioned to go to different provinces. Eminescu was assigned Moldavia. That summer, he quite by chance
    ran into his brother Iorgu, a military officer, in Cișmigiu Gardens, but firmly rebuffed Iorgu's attempt to get him to
    renew his ties to his family.
    
    Still in the summer of 1869, he left Pascaly's troupe and traveled to Cernăuţi and Iaşi. He renewed ties to his family;
    his father promised him a regular allowance to pursue studies in Vienna in the fall. As always, he continued to write
    and publish poetry; notably, on the occasion of the death of the former ruler of Wallachia, Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei, he
    published a leaflet, La moartea principelui Știrbei ("On the Death of Prince Știrbei").</p>
